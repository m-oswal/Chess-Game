It's a chess game made on c++.
To play the game simply run the code,
add coordinates of the piece you want to move (syntax = alphabet number,eg:h 4, a 1) and press enter,
then add the coordinates where you want to move it to(syntax = alphabet number,eg:h 4, a 1).

The first move can be played by white piece which are in capital and in bottom rows.

Currently the game lacks the functionality of check and checkmate,keeping track of the moves made and will only run for 6 moves.
The above functionality will be added over time.
